         <p> block level is nothing but what ever tags we use after completion it doesnt allow other tags to come beside that tag , it send that tag to next line even if there is enough space</p>

        <!-- for ex of block level -->

        <p> this is p tag written in first line , ther is so much space</p>

        <p> the second p will display in second line even the above has more space to fit the second line .</p>
